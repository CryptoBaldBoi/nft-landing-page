        <h1>NFT VENDOR</h1>
        
        <p>The NFT Vendor is a web-3 based NFT project set up to create awareness, educate people, promote NFT, Crypto and Web-3 projects and to expose fake projects in web-3 spaces.The project was inspired by the lack of awareness on NFT and web-3 space. We believe that every artist deserve to be appreciated.There are lots of Great projects out there that are not getting enough attention due to lack of awareness and information, so many people donâ€™t really know of them. </p>

        
        <p>So many talented artists out there, but the society doesn't appreciate their talents. I see some of those wasted, government imposed heavy tax fee on those trying to make a living with their talents, while some have given up on the centralization of the real world. I want to teach and bring hope to these people so when they see or hear CryptoBaldBoi they see hope. I want to teach them the decentralization of web3.</p>
